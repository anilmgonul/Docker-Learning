## INTRODUCTION

### What is Docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

### What are containers?

Containers are a solution to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another. This could be from a developerâ€™s laptop to a test environment, from a staging environment into production, and perhaps from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in a private or public cloud.

### Why to Use Docker?

It is simply because it makes it possible to get far more apps running on the same old servers and it also makes it very easy to package and ship programs.

### Dockerfile

It is a simple text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Setting up the Computer / Environment

After installing the Docker, we can test Docker installation by running the following:

### Playing with BusyBox

Docker yuklenmesi ve calismasi test edildikten sonra, pratik kazanimi elde etmek adina basit bir uygulama gelistirerek Docker dunyasina girme vakti. Bu kisimda, **BusyBox** konteynerinin calistirilmasi ve buna bagli olarakta `docker run` komutu ele alinacaktir.

Bu baglamda, asagidaki komutu terminalimize yazalim:
